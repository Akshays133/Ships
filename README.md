# Ships
Search ships
In this we used redux state library for state management of api data in the store then send in the props for the using pure functions.
Have more than one reducer for the reducer Work and for the action of the function and also used types file for the implementation of variable and one file separated from the main.

use form tag for the search of ships and search on change in form.

Used netlify for the hosting. Live at https://spacexships.netlify.app/
